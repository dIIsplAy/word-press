ABOUT Theme
=========== 
The advocate theme is a entirely corporate theme suitable for professional services businesses such as accountants and law firms. Upload your own logo, choose one of the bundled background images or upload your own rich imagery to brand your site. The dedicated home page template can also slide a range of brand images in the background, powered by a native WordPress gallery. The advocate theme also comes bundled with an optional plugin to add a custom post type for staff profiles. Combined with the bespoke profile templates this makes it easy to profile the most important part of your business, the people.

This theme is compatible with Wordpress Version 3.4 and above and it supports the new theme customization API (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API).
